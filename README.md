Game we're making with the skills we cover in the live stream. Text adventure. Zombie survival.

## Milestones
_I'll do my best to mark which commits line up with which code katas (from the twitch sessions)._

### Phase I - The foundation of our game mechanics.
* Factory Pattern _(Creational Pattern)_:  Get us off the ground and create some objects.
* Strategy Pattern _(Behavorial Pattern)_: Help deal with some granular complexity..
* Bridge Pattern _(Strutural Pattern)_:  Start getting some of our code organized.

### Phase II - Building out our world and fine tuning interactions with that world.
* Builder Pattern_(Creational Pattern)_: Help create our world (Environment).
* State Pattern _(Behavorial Pattern)_: Add some more complexity to our game Actors (Players/Monsters).
* Decorator Pattern_(Strutural Pattern)_: Organize the various things that can impact actions and attributes for our Actors.

### Phase III - *(TBD)* The game engine is the god of our world and will enforce all of our laws.
* CQRS Pattern:
* Event Sourcing:
* Observer _(Behavorial Pattern)_:
* Chain of Responsibility _(Behavorial Pattern)_:
* Command Pattern _(Behavorial Pattern)_:

### Phase IV - *(TBD)* Storage and Retrival
* Unit of Work:
* Repository:

### Phase V ### - *(TBD)* Explore Advanced Patterns via https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn600223.aspx
